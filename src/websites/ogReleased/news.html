<h3>
My Friend's Website
</h3>
<p>
As none of you know (until now), my friend has a website. The only reason i'm putting this here is because he has supported me in a lot of ways, advertised this website, and more. He is also just a good person that deserves more than three people on his website. Granted, his website is still a work in progress, but I think that you will enjoy your time there. And you're gonna email me "why is this in news?", the best answer: I want to get it out there, to the world, so what better way than putting it on news? And also, what other spot is there for this? Anyway, please check it out <a href="http://vmassistant.net">here</a>. If you go there and then bash him with mean comments, don't. Thank you :).

    <h3>Website Redesign!!!</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>For about 4 months, this website has the "Simple Dark" Feel, but I myself feel that new features, new look. This will include all the stuff such as the poly accounts, main site, shop (once I get there) and subdomains etc. It will turn into something that many people have not done since the 2000's...... support for 4:3 aspect ratio and design for all ratios . And to come with this, there still will be the old dark feel, but can be switched in your poly account settings. So people that read this, it won't be now sadly. It's gonna be in about 2 months. Well it is 14/10/2017 right now, so if you are in the future, hope you like :).</p>

    <h3>form.</h3> <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>Some of you may know that Poly is making a new game called form.. There is more info in <a href="Products.html">here</a>. The game is currently undergoing production at it was started apx. 2 weeks ago. Right now, it is about 2% done and it is estimated that it will take about 8 months to 14 months. The realease will be a week or two after the final touches. It will go on steam for PC(Windows), Mac and Ubuntu. If it hits over 5 million buys, then we at Poly will realease a hardcopy of form. 500 for PC, 100 for Mac and 100 for Ubuntu. The Premium version will have 1/10 of the realeases. Form. will also be having changes such as online levels will be implemented to the game before update 1.1. The reason for this is so when the game loses the hype and then the player will be wanting a new update, they will still have the community to give entertainmet while waiting.</p>
