            Here at Poly we make games and other neat stuff. The other neat stuff is usually experimental Discord bots, web tools, little tools, etc. the real products made are games. The first game released under the Poly name was fdphysics. Fdphysics was supposed to be a 2D shooting showdown with loads of physics, and it was that, but really buggy and subpar quality. You can find it for free on itch.io or in the products tab. The second game released (or soon to be released) is planeagement. Planeagement is all about managing your planes going to other airports and back. Make money based on the popularity of the route and the number of passengers you brought back. Keep up your reputation or else you'll lose that airport permanently. Buy upgrades and more airplanes to manage even more airports. Play in 30 different cities from all around the world, each with unique stats that differs from the others. With 3 challenges per city to make the total number of challenges 90, and a challenge editor, you'll have a great time trying to get the best time on each of the challenges.

            Games & Future Releases
            </h1>
            <p>
            Currently, Poly has 2 games out, planeagement and fdphysics. You can learn more about them in the products tab above. But there are more future releases already planned to release. One of the games is a metroidvania style crafting game, hopefully releasing in 2021. The next game will be a 3D game that will be a hack n slash. Hopefully should be releasing late 2020. Might also get a vr port if it does well. Afterwards there might be more products to come, but that'll be in the future, and will be annouced in the future. There will be open source discord bots releasing too, but they are unplanned when it comes to when they are going to be released.

            <h1>Redesign</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
            The Poly site has been redesigned to be a bit better to read plus better in general. Gone are the images of the links and now they are just text. Something that you can read easily. The Poly user links have been removed because they were old in style and hard to use in practice. There were loads of bugs that couldn't be easily patched plus it somehow got more and more buggy overtime. I (poly) made that when I was 12, (and I'm 14 now), and I've learned a lot about how web apps should be made, and I just realised that I just made the website incorrectly from the start. It might be remade, but the answer will come probably next year, as this one is all about development of games.
