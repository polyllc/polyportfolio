           <h1>Redesign</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
            The Poly site has been redesigned to be a bit better to read plus better in general. Gone are the images of the links and now they are just text. Something that you can read easily. The Poly user links have been removed because they were old in style and hard to use in practice. There were loads of bugs that couldn't be easily patched plus it somehow got more and more buggy overtime. I (poly) made that when I was 12, (and I'm 14 now), and I've learned a lot about how web apps should be made, and I just realised that I just made the website incorrectly from the start. It might be remade, but the answer will come probably next year, as this one is all about development of games.
