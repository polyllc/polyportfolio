            Poly LLC is a company that makes games and other neat tools. With all the programs and games made by a 14 year old and the company backed by his dad. Poly is all about making games in new ways, as the one dev was never taught the "right" way to make games. You might find unique stuff or stuff that you'd never think of. We don't plan on stopping anytime soon, so check back ever so often to see what we have to say in the updates or to see if we released a new game.
