        <p style='font-family: "Arial" sans-serif; text-align: justify; line-height: 200%;'>Glad you asked, fdphysics is a 2d shooting showdown, where you and another player battle it out (with guns) to see who is victorious. With physics, lots of it. You can change physics to your liking, like movement speed, gravity, jump height and more.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 style='font-family: "Arial Black" monospace;'>Features of  <img src="fdphysics.png" height=50 style="vertical-align: text-bottom; margin-bottom: -6; margin-left: -5; margin-right: -5;">    </h1>

Here are some of the features of fdphysics:
<br>
--- AI Modes ---

Play with 4 different AI modes to test your skills. Play with the easy AI if you want absolutely no challenge at all or want to test something out. Play with the Normal AI if you are starting out. Play with the hard AI to get a challenge. Play with the impossible AI to never win in physimatches. The impossible AI has faster special attack charges, more health, gets less damage from bullets and more. 
<img src="Screenshot%20(281).png" width="30%">
--- 3 modes to play ---
Play in 3 different game modes. Deathmatch, Damagematch and Physimatch. Deathmatch sees who gets the most kills. Damagematch sees who delt the most damage. Physimatch counts everything, jumps, shoots, special attack uses, etc. 
<br>
--- Physics ---

Change the physics of the game to play how you want to! Change movement speed, bullet speed, gravity or much more. Make the game more fun, give yourself a challenge, or make the game unplayable, it's all there. 
            <img src="Screenshot%20(273).png" width="30%" style="text-align: right; margin-left: 35%;">
<br>
--- 10 Maps and 20 Guns ---

Play on 10 different maps to test your skills! From classics like "Might Be a Castle" to new ones like "Not Sure if this is a Boat", you will have fun on every stage. But beware, seagulls might try and kill you on some stages! On each map, there are 4 guns, 20 guns in total. From the tried and true Machine Gun or to the nominee of "Why did they make this?" the Killer Seagull gun, you will find the gun that you will like, and use it. 
<br>
--- Charge your special attack! ---
Charge your special attack to get an upgrade to your gun for 10 second. Whether it is 3x reload or 3x bullets, it'll be sure to give you an edge. 
<br>
--- Support for many gamepads ---
<br>
Play with all the gamepads that have a dpad, 2 trigger buttons, 2 joysticks and 4 face buttons. All gamepads that Windows 10 supports natively will work. Fdphysics automatically maps the controllers to each player, so no need to restart your computer when you have a controller on a different player other than 1. 
<br>
Only Xbox controllers were tested, but PlayStation controllers do work. <br>
             <img src="Screenshot%20(248).png" width="30%">
<br>

--- Extra Features --- 

Seagulls<br>
Easy controls, only 7 buttons (keyboard) to move, jump, charge special attack, equip and shoot. And only 4 buttons to charge special attack, equip, shoot and jump, with the left joystick to move.<br>
Some more seagulls<br>
Takes 10-20 seconds to get into a match, no need to waste time by clicking buttons forever on the menu<br>
Coconuts<br>
A help button, for those that need help in the game<br>
A helpful little thing in the pause menu to see what controllers are plugged in<br>
A pause menu<br>
Full controller support, no need to use the mouse (unless leaving the game)<br>
Dustbushes <br>
Lots of sfx<br>
A credits button, see the one person that made this game, and the lovely people that tested it<br>
A play button so you can play the game<br><br>

 <img src="Screenshot%20(265).png" width="30%" style="text-align: right; margin-left: 35%;">
Not convinced? There is a demo so you can play the game with the hard AI on the original map to test out the game. <br>

If you want to contribute to the game by giving ideas, then you can check out the Poly LLC discord server, and also get the game for free if you do have some good ideas!<br>
